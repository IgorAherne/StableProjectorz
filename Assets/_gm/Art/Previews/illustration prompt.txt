I want to create a cool illustration for my software called StableProjectorz
My 3d software is oriented about "shining" or "projecting" 2d images onto the surface, like light-cookies or shadowmapping technique. So it's coloring these 3d objects using Projections. 

So I want the illustration to be a little bit cartoony (not too much - think about the hand-painted style of a game).  A little bit cute, and shouldn't feel repelling nor sinister. Give it a sense of depth

Depict a WIZARD (WE SEE HIM FROM BEHIND), WHO IS HOLDING A LANTERN, SHINING LIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS, illuminating the scene. THERE ARE SHADOWS AND WARM COZY LIGHTING FROM THE LANTERN. 

When the lantern's bright RAYS REACH THE TREES AND OBJECTS, THEY REVEAL A 3D WIREFRAME ON THEIR SURFACES.  Show glowing wireframe on such objects, BUT ONLY WHERE THE LIGHT ILLUMINATES THEM. MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE TEXT StableProjectorz. 




"A whimsical, semi-cartoonish illustration of a wizard seen from behind, clearly holding a magical lantern casting warm, cozy light in all directions. 
The scene is set in a mystical forest with trees and objects around the wizard. 
The bright rays from the lantern reveal glowing 3D wireframes on the surfaces of these trees and objects, but only where the light touches them. 
The wireframes have a vivid, glowing appearance, contrasting with the softer light of the lantern. 
Include the text 'StableProjectorz' in a style that blends with the magical and technological theme of the image. 
The overall atmosphere should be friendly and inviting, emphasizing the wizard holding the lantern
